    <!-- When you include the attribute "loading=lazy" in an image tag, it tells the browser 
    to delay the loading of the image until it is about to come into the user's viewport,
     or until the user starts scrolling towards it. This means that images located further 
     down the page or outside the initial viewport are not loaded immediately when the page
      loads. Instead, they are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls or interacts with the page. -->
